Logistics Management System
## **Problem Statement:** 
A Logistic Management System to automate tracking, optimize routes, and enhance inventory management for efficient and cost-effective supply chain operations.
### **Description:** 
Supply chain, poor logistics management can lead to higher costs, delays, and wasted resources. Many businesses still use outdated methods like manual tracking and scattered communication, making it hard to monitor inventory, shipments, and deliveries in real time. This often causes late deliveries, unhappy customers, and mismanagement.
To solve these issues, a Logistic Management System (LMS) is needed to make operations smoother by automating tracking, planning better delivery routes, and managing inventory efficiently. The system should give real-time updates, schedule tasks automatically, and predict possible delays to improve efficiency, cut costs, and ensure on-time deliveries.
This solution will include features like order tracking, route planning, inventory monitoring, and automatic notifications, making the logistics process easier and more reliable.
